# QR Code Card

This is my third project in my Front-end journey! Feel free to give me a star 😄
<br>
It features a responsive QR Code card component by using only HTML and CSS.
<br>
I was able to create a very useful card that everyone has seen in life 😄

## 🧠 Best practices

It features **variables**, **BEM**, **responsive function** (as media queries wasn't needed) - min(380px, 80%)

I also used Prettier to make the layout better on **VSCode** and used the command line for versioning with Git.
